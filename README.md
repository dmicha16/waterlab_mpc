# waterlab_mpc
A Model Predictive Controller in for use in Urban Drainage Networks (UDNs) to mitigate  Combined Sewer Overflows (CSOs)

## Installations and requirements
1) Install https://git-scm.com/downloads
	You can also install a git GUI if you’d rather not do terminal based git management like this https://desktop.github.com/

2) Install anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/
	A base environment is generally created for you when you install anaconda.
	In here install jupyter lab 
	`conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab`
	Once we have the repo we’ll create an updated anaconda environment.yml to share the dependencies through git.
	Some basic python packages to skim through
	Pandas https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/10min.html
	Numpy https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html
